  <h2><span id="What_is_Wrongful_Termination">What is Wrongful Termination?</span></h2>
<p>Wrongful termination occurs when an employee is fired by an employer in violation of an employee’s legal rights. There are several types of wrongful termination including <strong>discrimination</strong>, <strong>contract violations</strong>, sexual harassment, and <strong>retaliation</strong>. For more information, read more on the following points and contact a wrongful termination lawyer today!</p>
<h2><span id="Is_it_Hard_to_Prove_Unlawful_Termination">Is it Hard to Prove Unlawful Termination?</span></h2>
<p>Wrongful termination can sometimes be hard to prove, but getting the compensation you deserve is worth it. That is why it is so important to seek legal advice and guidance from an experienced employment and wrongful termination lawyer. Our team of wrongful termination lawyers in Los Angeles, CA utilizes an aggressive and comprehensive approach.</p>
<h2><span id="What_Does_California_Employment_Law_Protect_You_Against">What Does California Employment Law Protect You Against?</span></h2>
<p>A California Wrongful Termination Lawyer knows and understands the law surrounding your unlawful termination, or other protected workers right. Under California employment law, it is illegal for an employer to fire an employee or make any other employment decisions (such as being passed over for a promotion) for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discriminatory reasons based on race, sex, or religion</li>
<li>Reasons that violate an employment contract</li>
<li>Reasons that are in revenge for an employee exercising certain legal rights</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, these laws place important limits on an employer’s ability to terminate employees. An employee fired for reasons that violate these laws may be entitled to a wrongful termination claim for lost wages, benefits, and more. If you believe you have been wrongfully terminated by your employer in California, contact Davtyan Law Firm today to discuss your case with a knowledgeable wrongful termination lawyer. Our Los Angeles based lawyers are experienced and equipped to handle your wrongful termination claim.</p>
<h2><span id="Discrimination_Claims_in_CA">Discrimination Claims in CA</span></h2>
<p>Workplace discrimination and wrongful termination are huge problems in California. An experienced California wrongful termination lawyer will identify practices that are normalized in the workplace, but in reality are discriminatory. Although illegal, discrimination in the workplace happens often and many employees don’t know the extent of their rights. Fortunately, there are statutes in place that protect employees like you from wrongful termination and give those who are unjustly fired a way to get justice. Under California employment law, it is unlawful for an employer to fire an employee for discriminatory reasons or make any employment decision on the basis of one or more personality traits, known as “<strong>protected characteristics</strong>.”</p>
<h3>What is Considered a Protected Characteristic Under California Law?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Race, color, national origin, or ancestry</li>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Physical disability, mental disability, or other medical condition</li>
<li>Genetic information</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>Sex, gender, gender identity or gender expression</li>
<li>Pregnancy or childbirth</li>
<li>Age (for employees over the age of 40)</li>
<li>Sexual orientation</li>
<li>Military or veteran status</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe you experienced an unfair dismissal because of your membership in one or more of these protected categories, you may have a wrongful termination claim against your employer. Consult one of the experienced Los Angeles wrongful termination lawyer at Davtyan Law Firm today to discuss your possible case.</p>

<h3>Employment Contract Violations</h3>
<p>Another type of wrongful termination in California involves termination in violation of employment contracts. If you were fired from your job in California, and you believe your termination was carried out in violation of your employment contract (which promised you job security or continued employment for a certain period of time or prohibited your employer from firing you without just cause) you may have a wrongful termination claim. Our wrongful termination lawyers have won many cases for our clients and we can help you too!</p>
<h3>Retaliation Claims</h3>
<p>Employers are also prohibited from firing an employee for exercising his or her employment rights. A professional wrongful termination lawyer is familiar with these rights that include taking time off for qualified medical or family reasons, filing a complaint of workplace harassment or discrimination, filing a workers’ compensation claim for a workplace injury, taking time off for jury duty, or filing a complaint of illegal wage and hour practices. If you believe you have been fired for illegal reasons such as discrimination or retaliation contact our experienced lawyers today to file a wrongful termination claim.</p>
<h3>Violation of Public Policy Claims</h3>
<p>According to employment law, employees may not be fired for refusing to commit an illegal act, exercising a legal right, or filing a complaint about being denied such a right. This is a less common, but still important type of wrongful termination and you may be entitled to compensation. When you are in need of a wrongful termination lawyer on your site, Davtyan Law is the firm for you!</p>
<h2><span id="Contact_Davtyan_Law_Today_for_Legal_Help">Contact Davtyan Law Today for Legal Help</span></h2>
<p>There are state and federal laws in place that prohibit wrongful termination in California. But many California employees who lose their jobs for unlawful reasons never get the legal help they need.

For help or information about your termination-related legal issue, contact a professional wrongful termination lawyer at Davtyan Law.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Issues_Does_a_California_Wage_Lawyer_Deal_With">What Issues Does a California Wage Lawyer Deal With?</span></h2>
<p>Hour &amp; Wage Lawyers cover issues like <strong>minimum wage</strong>, <strong>overtime pay</strong>, <strong>tips</strong>, and <strong>meal and rest breaks</strong> in California.</p>
<p>Often it’s hard for employees to know if their rights have been violated without the guidance of an experienced attorney. When California employers violate wage and hour laws, and employees don’t know their rights they are not able to protect themselves and are most likely missing out on pay that they are entitled to. Some common wage and hour law violations in California include failure to pay the minimum wage, failure to pay overtime (for time worked over 40 hours) to employees, failure to provide meal and/or rest breaks, and misclassifying employees as independent contractors.</p>
<p>If you believe you have been the victim of a California wage and hour law violation, contact a knowledgeable California wage lawyer at Davtyan Law Firm as soon as possible to discuss your rights.</p>
<h2><span id="Understanding_Californias_Wage_and_Hour_Laws">Understanding California’s Wage and Hour Laws</span></h2>
<p>California employment law protects employees even more than federal employment laws. You may be entitled to more than you think under California’s strict employment standards. That’s why it is crucial to have an attorney who is an expert in California employment standards guide you through this process.</p>
<p>The federal wage and hour law is called the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but California also has its version of this act, which rank among the most complex in the country in protecting employee wage rights. These laws are covered by the California Labor Code and the Wage Orders and enforced by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE).</p>
<p>Often, California offers broader protections than federal regulations, and when that happens, employers are required to follow rulings that are most generous to employees. For instance, California has a higher minimum wage requirement than under federal law, which means employers in California must pay employees a higher amount. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, but the minimum wage for California workers is $12.00 per hour.</p>
<h2><span id="Can_I_file_a_claim_for_failure_to_pay_overtime">Can I file a claim for failure to pay overtime?</span></h2>
<p>California employee protections are also more comprehensive for overtime pay. Overtime only applies to certain employees, however. Overtime pay is typically required when an employee has worked more than 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week. Overtime only applies to certain employees, however. Employees that must be paid overtime include most hourly employees like hospitality workers, cashiers, and construction workers. If you have worked over 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week and believe you have not been fairly compensated, you may be entitled to take legal action to receive your overtime pay. Count on an experienced wage and hour attorney from Davtyan Law Firm who has extensive experience in fighting for their clients’ employment rights.</p>
<h2><span id="Filing_a_California_Wage_and_Hour_Claim">Filing a California Wage and Hour Claim</span></h2>
<p>California provides significant protections for employees’ wages and hours, and any violation of these protections may result in a wage and hour claim being filed by the employee. Some of the most common wage and hour violations in California include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failing to fully pay employees on time</li>
<li>Failing to fully relieve employees of work duties during breaks</li>
<li>Misclassifying employees as independent contractors</li>
<li>Misclassifying regular hourly (non-exempt) employees as “exempt” employees</li>
<li>Failing to track or pay overtime wages</li>
<li>Failing to follow the rules on final paychecks</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, California employee labor standards violations occur all too frequently. In some cases, these violations are unintentional – the employer may simply be unaware of his or her legal duties. However, in other cases, employers deliberately violate labor standards to avoid paying employees the wages they are entitled to or forcing them to work uncompensated or under-compensated hours. By filing a wage and hour claim, employees whose rights have been violated can pursue financial compensation for their losses.</p>
<h2><span id="How_an_Experienced_Wage_Lawyer_Can_Help">How an Experienced Wage Lawyer Can Help</span></h2>
<p>If your employer has failed to pay you minimum wage or the appropriate wages for overtime hours, or if your employer requires that you continue working through a meal break or rest period, you may be entitled to compensation in the form of a wage and hour claim. A knowledgeable wage lawyer at Davtyan Law Firm can help you determine if a violation has occurred and decided your best course of action, which may include filing a wage and hour lawsuit in a California court. Our attorneys at Davtyan Law Firm have extensive experience handling California wage and hour claims and will work tirelessly to get you the compensation you deserve.

<h2><span id="Have_You_Been_Discriminated_Against_or_Harassed_in_Your_Workplace">Have You Been Discriminated Against or Harassed in Your Workplace?</span></h2>
<p>Everyone knows that discrimination is wrong, but it unfortunately still occurs in the workplace. Workplace discrimination occurs when an employer treats an employee or job applicant less favorably than other employees or applicants because of a specific personal characteristic, such as race, gender, color or marital status. In many cases, California employers are not allowed discrimination against employees by firing, refusing to hire, demoting, refusing to promote, or taking other negative actions against members of a protected class. These practices go against the civil rights laws enacted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the EEOC.</p>

<h2><span id="Californias_At-Will_Employment_Statute">California’s At-Will Employment Statute</span></h2>
<p>Because California is an at-will employment state, employers typically have the right to fire employees at any time and for any <strong>lawful</strong> reason, with or without notice. However, California laws prohibit employers from firing employees for <strong>unlawful</strong> reasons such as discrimination and workplace retaliation. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has enacted laws such as the Civil Rights Act to prevent discrimination in the workplace that act as exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine.</p>
<h3>What are the Exceptions to this Statute?</h3>
<p>Employers are prohibited from firing employees or making any other employment decisions if they are motivated by an unlawful reason, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discrimination based on race, color, ancestry or national origin</li>
<li>Discrimination based on religious creed</li>
<li>Discrimination based on physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, or genetic information</li>
<li>Discrimination based on Marital status</li>
<li>Harassment based on Sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression</li>
<li>Discrimination based on pregnancy or childbirth</li>
<li>Discrimination based on Age (for employees over 40)</li>
<li>Discrimination based on Sexual orientation</li>
<li>Discrimination based on military and veteran status</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the broadest and most important anti-discrimination law for employees in California is the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), there are other laws that offer protection against workplace discrimination and harassment in the state, including those that prohibit immigration-based discrimination, language discrimination, political discrimination or discrimination against victims of crimes. Hiring attorneys who are experienced in this field of law is crucial to understanding your rights and getting the compensation you are entitled to.</p>
<h2><span id="How_Discrimination_Lawyers_Identify_Harassment_in_the_Workplace">How Discrimination Lawyers Identify Harassment in the Workplace</span></h2>
<p>California employers are also prohibited from creating a work environment that excludes certain employees or puts them at a disadvantage because of their race, gender, age, etc. Similarly, employers cannot harass an employee on the basis of a protected characteristic, nor can they create or maintain a hostile work environment that leaves a protected member with no choice but to quit. As an individual and an employee, you have rights against discrimination and harassment based on your national origin, age, sex or any other protected characteristics. Our attorneys are experienced in handling discrimination and harassment cases.

<h2><span id="What_is_Workplace_Retaliation">What is Workplace Retaliation?</span></h2>
<p><em>Workplace retaliation</em> occurs when a business takes negative action against the employee who initially filed a complaint. If an employer punishes or fires an employee for exercising his or her employment rights, it is considered workplace retaliation and it may be illegal.</p>
<h3>How do I File a Retaliation Claim in California?</h3>
<p>A great place to start a workplace retaliation claim is to meet with a California workplace retaliation lawyer. Contact Davtyan Law Firm today if you believe you have been unlawfully retaliated against at work for engaging in a protected activity. Our experienced workplace retaliation attorneys will work hard to get you the compensation you deserve.</p>
<h2><span id="What_is_the_Difference_Between_Workplace_Retaliation_and_Discrimination">What is the Difference Between Workplace Retaliation and Discrimination?</span></h2>
<p><strong>Workplace retaliation</strong> happens when an employer fires, demotes, refuse to promote, or otherwise takes negative action against an employee for exercising or attempting to enforce his or her employment rights. For example, as a California employee, you cannot be fired for filing a workers’ compensation claim for a workplace injury, requesting or taking time off for qualified family or medical reasons, or filing a complaint of workplace harassment against your employer.</p>
<p><strong>Discrimination</strong> happens when an employer fires, demotes, refuses to promote or otherwise takes a negative action against an employee based on prejudice towards race, age, sex, etc. An employee may experience wrongful termination or harassment due to discrimination and decide to file a case. If the former employer attempts to take legal action towards you for making a complaint, this is now known as workplace retaliation.</p>
<p>Employer retaliation and discrimination in the workplace can sometimes occur together, but they are ultimately separate issues. Unlawful workplace retaliation occurs when an employee decides to complain about the workplace or engages in another protected activity and the employer responds by legal retaliation or wrongful termination. California law prohibits this kind of action, and workers have rights to both workplace discrimination and retaliation cases.</p>
<h2><span id="Common_Types_of_Workplace_Retaliation_in_California">Common Types of Workplace Retaliation in California</span></h2>
<p>An employer may respond negatively to a complaint filed against them after wrongful termination or any other violation of employment law rights. This is usually illegal workplace retaliation and can cause even more legal issues. Types of workplace retaliation fall under various employment law sectors and it is important that you understand your rights. If your employer has retaliated against you, you have legal rights and an experienced workplace retaliation lawyer can help you protect those rights.</p>
<h3>Whistle-Blower Retaliation Case</h3>
<p>California whistle-blower protection laws provide legal protection from workplace retaliation for employees who report suspected violations of the law by their employer. For example, these laws would protect an employee who reports suspected criminal activity by the employer to a law enforcement agency or an employee who reports a California employment law violation to the Labor Commissioner.</p>
<p>Any employer who fires an employee for reporting unlawful activities in the workplace, or for wrongfully believing the employee had reported a violation, commits workplace retaliation in violation of California employment law. When going against a corporation’s private employment lawyers, you need a law firm on your side that can defend your whistleblower’s rights.</p>
<h3>Common types of Retaliation cases that a Workplace Retaliation Lawyer handles</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Unpaid wages</strong> – Employees who believe they have been underpaid have a right to file an unpaid wage complaint with California’s Labor Commissioner, and it is against California labor law for employers to terminate, discharge exercise any other retaliation against employees who file such complaints.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unsafe work conditions</strong> – California employers are prohibited from firing or otherwise punishing employees who complain about harassment, unsafe work conditions or who report workplace safety issues to a government agency, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). It is also unlawful for employers to fire or punish employees who refuse to perform any work that would violate California’s occupational health and safety standards.</li>
<li>
<strong>Illegal work</strong> <strong>activities</strong>– It is against the law throughout California for employees to be fired or punished for refusing to commit an illegal act, for reporting unlawful activities at work, or for participating in an investigation into unlawful actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retaliation against Lawful Off-Duty Activities</h3>
<p>It is also against the California law for an employer to attempt to follow legal retaliation against lawful employee conduct during non-working hours. In many cases, whether the employer doesn’t personally agree with the employee’s off-duty activities, or believes they will adversely affect the reputation of his or her business, California employment law limits how much an employer can do to regulate the employee’s lawful conduct off the premises during non-working hours, including exercising free speech and engaging in political activity.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Do_California_Leave_Laws_Protect_You_From">What Do California Leave Laws Protect You From?</span></h2>
<p>California Leave Laws protect employees from unlawful discrimination, harassment or retaliation as a result of requesting or taking protected leave. Employees have a right to take these kinds of leaves, and employers cannot take certain actions just because you exercised that right. Additionally, California has a special set of laws known as <strong>The California Family Rights Act</strong> (CFRA) that protects an employee’s right to paid or unpaid leave.</p>
<p>The California Family Rights Act allows eligible employees to take up a total of 12 weeks of paid or unpaid job-protected leave for each year they are employed by the same employer. If your employer has retaliated against you because you requested or took a medical leave of absence, you may have a case against them. Contact our skilled California protected leave lawyers  at Davtyan Law Firm today to discuss your legal options.</p>
<h2><span id="Types_of_Protected_Leave_in_CA">Types of Protected Leave in CA</span></h2>
<p>Employees have certain personal needs that must be considered by their employers. California Laws were developed with the needs of the employee in mind. The state of California has some of the most generous leave laws in the country, making California employees some of the most protected employees in the nation in terms of taking time off work. The typical California employer will likely have to abide by most of these laws. The following are some of the leaves available to eligible California employees under state and federal laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</li>
<li>California Family Rights Act (CFRA)</li>
<li>New Parent Leave Act</li>
<li>Pregnancy Disability</li>
<li>Military Service</li>
<li>School Activities and Appearance</li>
<li>Victims of Domestic Abuse, Sexual Assault and Stalking</li>
<li>Crime Victims</li>
<li>Jury Duty and Witness</li>
<li>Voting</li>
<li>Organ and Bone Marrow Donation</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="What_Is_FMLA_Leave">What Is FMLA Leave?</span></h2>
<p>FMLA leave is the most common type of protected leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows an employee to take protected leave for a serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member, spouse or domestic partner. Employees are allowed to take up to 12 weeks of medical leave for these reasons. Your employer must abide by The FMLA if their business employs at least 50 employees. If you think you have been illegally denied your rights under The Family Medical Leave Act, call an experienced attorney to discuss your case.</p>
<h2><span id="Laws_Prohibiting_Discrimination_Retaliation">Laws Prohibiting Discrimination &amp; Retaliation</span></h2>
<p>The most important component of California leave laws is the fact that these laws are “protected.” This means that a California employer is required to rehire eligible employees who take a medical leave or other leave of absence to their previous position or to a similar position at the end of their leave. After all, there is little point in an employee taking a “leave of absence” if they won’t be able to return to their job when the leave is over. The term “protected” also means that employers in California cannot discriminate against, retaliate against or otherwise take negative employment action against employees who request or take a leave of absence. Unlawful discrimination or retaliatory action against an employee who takes a protected leave of action may include any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrongful termination</li>
<li>Wrongful demotion</li>
<li>Wrongful refusal to promote</li>
<li>Threats by your employer</li>
<li>Harassment</li>
<li>Intimidation by your employer</li>
<li>Coercion by your employer</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Legal_Remedies_for_Leave_Law_Violations">Legal Remedies for Leave Law Violations</span></h2>
<p>Too often, California employees’ rights are violated by employers who refuse to comply with state and federal leave laws. These employees may not realize that the law provides them with legal remedies in these situations. Any eligible employee denied the right to take a leave of absence provided by law, without punishment, may have grounds to sue his or her employer.</p>
<p>California law prohibits employers from interfering with an employee exercising or attempting to exercise his or her protected leave rights. Examples of such protected leaves are a medical leave due to your or a family member’s serious health condition. An employee who has been denied the right to take a protected leave of absence, or punished or discriminated against for requesting or taking leave may be able to file a lawsuit for a leave law violation.</p>
